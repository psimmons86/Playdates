Xcode Project Update Instructions
================================

Since we've consolidated the app into a 2-tab structure (Dashboard and Social),
follow these steps to update your Xcode project:

1. Remove old view references from project navigator:
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Explore
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Playdates  
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Friends
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Profile
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Home

2. Add new view structure:
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/Social/SocialView.swift
   - PlaydatesApp/Views/MainTabView.swift (already updated)

3. Make sure all views import the ModelImports file:
   import "PlaydatesApp/Utils/ModelImports.swift"
   
4. Update project settings to remove any build phase references to deleted files

5. Clean build folder (Shift+Command+K) and rebuild project
